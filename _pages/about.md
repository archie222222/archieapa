I’m an electrical and lighting systems engineer based in Dubai, specializing in **architectural lighting**, **façade illumination**, and **lighting control systems (DALI / DMX)** for demanding projects across the UAE.

I work on cultural landmarks, public realm installations, hospitality environments, commercial spaces, and retail projects—bridging the gap between design intent, technical requirements, and site realities.

Alongside engineering work, I also build **tools and workflows** (Excel/VBA automation, data-driven templates, and scripting experiments) that help design teams work faster, more accurately, and more consistently.
